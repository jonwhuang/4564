# Let's Analyze Words!!! ~ L.A.W.!!!

### The issue we're trying to solve:
When people speak during job interviews or presentations, or give speeches, they might not realize that the wording they choose can affect others.

Studies have proven that words can subconsciously affect people.

There is also a lot of [anecdotal evidence and self-help topics](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20check%20how%20your%20words%20affect%20others) that say that the choice of words also affects the speaker's perception/outlook in life.

The goal of our tool is to help people: 

- improve themselves by thinking of how positive or negative their word choices are, and think about better wording.
- stop unintentionally offending others and/or giving a negative impression to others.

### How it is right now:
- People rely on feedback from others
- These feedback can be:
  - subjective
  - inexact

### What we have created:
- Our tool makes analyzing the way we use words:
  - quantifiable
  - easy to track

### Technologies used:
- [HPE Haven On Demand API](https://dev.havenondemand.com/)
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- HTML5
- CSS & Bootstrap
